# BudgetApp

This is the first version of my Budget App. I am currently trying to figure out how to make the download button work
as a legit download button, rather than a .print(). Will update soon! 

Please note this was a collaborate project for an Udemy course I took Summer 2019. 

Feel free to give me feedback! I'm always willing to improve and learn new things!
